# Forest-fire-analysis-of-Canada
It aimed to identify the major causes responsible for forest fires and
propose mitigation steps. In this project I have used data visualization
tools like matplotlib and seaborn to analyze the data and used geopandas library for hotspot analysis of areas with high occurence.
